"""I'm making a custom 'accounts' module (app?),
because I want to redirect after login / logout (register?),
and for some reason I couldn't get the behaviour that I want.
Plus we probably want more custome behaviours in the future anyway,
specifically I don't want to redirect user to a login page if possible,
and make a new login div or something in current page instead (?)"""
